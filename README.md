# Project_4_Multiple_View_Modeling

This is a project on photometric stereo reconstruction based on a dense set of images acquired from an object that is observed by a fixed camera under different illumination, in the presence of large shadows, highlight, transparencies, complex geometry, variable attenuation in light intensity and inaccurate light directions. The algorithm is based on the paper [Dense Photometric Stereo Using a Mirror Sphere and Graph Cut](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp5421/Password_Only/projects/photo/01467260.pdf).<br>
